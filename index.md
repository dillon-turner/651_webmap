This project explores New York City's NYPD complaint data for the year 2019, along with several characteristics of New York City that may be potentially linked to New York's complaint rate. These features focus on the built environment, meaning the layout of buildings and amentities within each block group of NYC. This
The study is influenced by the idea of crime prevention through the built environment which has had several phases since its inception during the 1960s and 1970s.
