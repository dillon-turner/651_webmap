This project explores New York City's NYPD complaint data for the year 2019, along with several characteristics of New York City that may be potentially linked to New York's complaint rate. NYPD Complaint data contains geo-located complaints, or crimes, reported to the New York Police Department going back to 2006. However, this study will exclusively focus on all complaints reported in 2019. There are two main reasons to focus on one specific year: one, the boundaries relating to census data are time sensitive, meaning every ten years when redistricting occurs the boundaries for these study areas shifts. So, it is best to keep within one of these set ten year spans for consistency. Two, the built environment in any city is constantly shifting and it is difficult to find historic building footprints that are geo-mapped, and in with respect to NYC, only the most recent building information is easily accessible on the NYC Open Data portal.  Additionally, since the COVID-19 pandemic started, crime has seemingly been more aggressive and prevalent in NYC and around the country, so studying crimes form 2020 and on would be less significant compared to the trends seen from 2000-2019. 

These features focus on the built environment, meaning the layout of buildings and amentities within each block group of NYC. This
The study is influenced by the idea of crime prevention through the built environment which has had several phases since its inception during the 1960s and 1970s.
